= PYLA =

Pure python linear algebra

* Features
 - Basic matrix and verctor operations: multiplication, summation, scaling, transposition etc.
 - Some more advanced matrix decompositions:
   - QR decomposition
   - SVD decomposition
   

* Performance
  Performance is not a primary goal for PYLA. If you need performance, use of native libraries, such as Numpy, is highly recommended.

* Why use PYLA 
  PYLA is
  - Lightweight. It is much smaller than Numpy
  - Standard pure Python. It should work on every pyhton implementation, that is decent enough.
  - Generic. It is not limited by floats. Particularly, you can use GMPY's long floats with all matrix algorithms.
